# PSICK Cards ruleset: Dice fight

This mode needs any number of PSICK cards, a 6 faces dice and at least 2 players.

## Players

From 2 to any.

Each player should be able to see the cards in front of each, other player, so it could become a mess when more than 10 players ;-)

### Variations

Different player grouping modes can be used:

  - Free for all. Every player plays on her own.
  - Team Deathmatch. Players are divided in two or more teams, at the end each player's score is added to the one of her team
  - King of the Hill. A player plays against all the others. The King picks, for each dice roll, one card for each other players agains her. At the end the King score is compared to the one of all the other players.

## Cards

Can be used any card from PSICK deck.

All the cards are grouped in a single central pile, there's no fixed number about the number of cards to use.

They should not be less than the number of players, and can be as many as the number of times you want to roll a dice in a single game.

A good number is around 20-40 possible value could be 40-50. Possibly the number of cards should be a multiple of the number of players.

### Variations

Cards distribution can be done in different ways:

  - Non competitive. A deck is used and its cards return to its owner. Play for fun!
  - Competitive. Each player puts her own cards in the deck, winners can win (and get) real cards from other players. Play for Your cards! And fun.
  - Competitive with Host. Host generously provides the cards, players win and take the cards. Play with others cards and win them.

## Game

All cards are piled in the center.

The first player (chosen in whatever way) rolls a dice. If 5 is the result, 4 cards are moved to a second pile and the fifth card is picked and played in front of her, with the back visible.

Next player (whosen by whatever logic) rolls the dice, moves cards to the second pile and takes the one corresponding to the dice value.

This card is placed in front of the player and can be used to steal any other card in front of any other player. In order to steal a card, the attack of the picked card must be same or higher than the defense of the card that is stealed.

Stealed cards are placed, as picked cards, in front of the player who steals them, and can be themselves stealed by other players in the following turns.

If the card attack is lower than the defence of any other card, then no steal is possible and the card is just picked and placed in front of its player.

### Variations

Stealing modes can be:

  - Opportunistic. Players can decide if to steal or not other cards, can decide not to steal cards that she could steal.
  - Mandatory. If a picked card can steal any other player's card, then it MUST steal it.
  - Conditional. Stealing can be done only if some other conditions are met. For example only if dice number matches the card cathegory number, or if the player is adjacent (useful when there are may players) or if any other conditition, agreeded at the beginning of the game, is matched.

## End Game
In each turn a player rolls a dice, moves the corresponding number of cards in a discard pile and places the picked card in front of him.
