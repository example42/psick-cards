# PSICK Cards ruleset: Dice Fight

This mode needs any number of PSICK cards, a 6 faces dice and at least 2 players.

## Players

From 2 to any.

Each player should be able to see the cards in front of each, other player, so it could become a mess when more than 10 players ;-)

### Variations

Different player grouping modes can be used:

  - **Free for all**. Every player plays on her own.
  - **Team Deathmatch**. Players are divided in two or more teams, at the end each player's score is added to the one of her team
  - **King of the Hill**. A player plays against all the others. The King picks, for each dice roll, one card for each other players agains her. At the end the King score is compared to the one of all the other players.

## Cards

Can be used any card from PSICK deck.

All the cards are grouped in a single central pile, there's no fixed number about the number of cards to use.

They should not be less than the number of players, and can be as many as the number of times you want to roll a dice in a single game.

A good number is around 20-40 possible value could be 40-50. Possibly the number of cards should be a multiple of the number of players.

### Variations

Cards distribution can be done in different ways:

  - **Non competitive**. A deck is used and its cards return to its owner. Play for fun!
  - **Competitive**. Each player puts her own cards in the deck, winners can win (and get) real cards from other players. Play for Your cards! And fun.
  - **Competitive with Host**. Host generously provides the cards, players win and take the cards. Play with others cards and win them.

## Game

All cards are piled in the center.

The first player (chosen in whatever way) rolls a dice. If 5 is the result, 4 cards are moved to a second pile and the fifth card is picked and played in front of her, with the back visible.

Next player (whosen by whatever logic) rolls the dice, moves cards to the second pile and takes the one corresponding to the dice value.

This card is placed in front of the player and can be used to steal any other card in front of any other player. In order to steal a card, the attack of the picked card must be same or higher than the defense of the card that is stealed.

Stealed cards are placed, as picked cards, in front of the player who steals them, and can be themselves stealed by other players in the following turns.

If the card attack is lower than the defence of any other card, then no steal is possible and the card is just picked and placed in front of its player.

When the first pile of cards is empty, player can start to pick cards from the second one, and keep on picking and discarding cards until they are finished.

### Variations

Stealing modes can be:

  - **Opportunistic**. Players can decide if to steal or not other cards, can decide not to steal cards that she could steal.
  - **Mandatory**. If a picked card can steal any other player's card, then it MUST steal it. If the player by mistake doesn't steal any card but there were possible cards to steal, the owner of the not-stealed card can steal any of the cards of the player who made the mistake.
  - **Conditional**. Stealing can be done only if some other conditions are met. For example only if dice number matches the card cathegory number, or if the player is adjacent (useful when there are may players) or if any other conditition, agreeded at the beginning of the game, is matched.

When a deck has less than 6 cards, and the dice number is higher than the available cards, different approaches can be followed:

  - **Always pick**. Players pick a card in any case (the dice corresponing one or just the last one if dice number is higher than available cards)
  - **All cards dice pick**. Players pick a card only if the dice number is equal or lower than all available cards
  - **Active pile dice pick**. Players pick a card only if the dice number is equal or lower than the cards present in the current active pile, once the pile is emptied, players can start yo use the one with discarded cards
  - **No dice pick.** Play without dice, cards are picked from the pile, according to players' turn order.

## End Game

When there are no more cards to pick, the game ends and players can start to count the gained points according to the cards that have remained in front of them (to the ones thay they picked or stolen).

### Variations

Points gained can be counted according to different logics:

  - Based on players groupings (per team or per player)
  - Points can be based on the number of cards remained to each player, or the sum of each card's value, or the some of other cards elements (the linked TOW number, or the sum of attack and defence, or anything).
  - Winner can be the ones who gets more points in a single match or reaches a predefined score after playing mupliple games


## Sample rules set

Here some sample set of rules based on Dice fight ruleset

### Family Dice Fight

Two or more players play in free for all mode with 20 cards in a non competitive way. Stealing is opportunistic, players pick a card only if the dice number is equal or lower to the cards in the active pile. At the end wins the players whose cards have the highest Cost sum.


### Dice Duel - CfgMgmt Camp 2018 edition

Played with a single POC Deck (10 cards, the first 10 ones, all different).

Competitive with Host, two players only: someone from example42 plays the host and provides the cards, challenger comes to the booth to claim victory and free cards.

Challenger begins, stealing is opportunistic, players pick a card in any case. Played with dice, if available.

At the end the challenger keeps all the cards it has gained, but if behaves nicely we might gift the whole POC deck ;-)


### Wild Beer Fight

Party mode: any number of players, around a pub's table, the more the better. Non Competitive Team Deatchmatch. Mandatory stealing, active pile dice pick, unless you get mad and go for an always pick.

Wins the team whose members have gathered more cards. Losing team pays the beer.

Occasional rules breaking allowed.
