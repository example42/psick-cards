# PSICK cards structure

Each PSICK card has the following information and structure:

  - A Front side. With a beautiful picture by Tatlin. There can be 2 or more cards with the same front side. Currently there are 10 different fronts.

  - A back side with all the additional information:

    - The card title
    - The card unique, progressive, number. Starting from 1.
    - The card text / information about how to use PSICK (the Puppet control-repo not the cards ;-)
    - Zero or more tags, relevant to the card's information
    - Zero or more references to other cards
    - The card "Attack" value. A number from 0 to ?? (In POC deck A < 10)
    - The card "Defence" value. A number from 0 to ?? (In POC deck D < 10)
    - The card "Cost" value. A number from 0 to ?? (In POC deck C < 10)
    - Marks at fixed positions on each side of the card
    - The card Type value from 1 to 6: 1-INF , 2-TRY , 3-DEV , 4-MOD , 5-DES  6-PRO
    - Zero o one reference to a TOW number (A reference to a relevant online example42's Tip of the Week blog post with more details of the card info)
    - A different background
    - Strange Tatlin symbols nobody yet knows how to use.

Any of these elements can be freely used to customise and design game rules.
