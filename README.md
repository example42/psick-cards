# PSICK cards

##### We provide the cards. You decide the rules!

PSICK cards is our fun side project around PSICK:

A collection of cards, informative game cards outlining different PSICK features and usage instructions, which might be used in any card game you may decide to invent and play.


### Where to get the cards

We distribute these cards at the events we attend, feel free to seek and challenge us to get your cards deck, possibly after winning a card game against us ;-)

Meet us and gain your cards at the following events:

  - [CfgMgmtCamp 2018](http://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/) 05-07.02.2018 - Ghent, Belgium
  - [PuppetConf 2018](http://puppetconf.com) 09-11.10.2018 - San Francisco, USA

If you ask kindly we can give you a deck anyway.


### Rules

There are no predefined rules or game modes. You can decide the rule sets and the variations to use.

There are no predefined number of players from 1 to any.

There is no minimum or maximum amout of cards to use in a game, it's up to you!

Each card has several distintive characteristics which can be used and define the game dynamics. Find more details, in the [cards structure](cards_structure.md) page.
 
We are designing and experimenting new game modes and rules, anything can be done, any element of the cards structure may be used. Find some samples in the [rules](rules/) section, and feel free to send your **pull requests** with new rules, suggestions or variations!

### Reference to Online example42's Tips of the Week

Each card may have a reference to a post from Example42 blog series [Puppet] Tip of the Week. The post provides more details and information on the topics described in the card. Needless to say that you also use this element to design and shape your game rules ;-)


### Decks

We play to release a first POC (Proof of Concept) DECK at CfgMgmtCamp. Plan is to have at least 10 different cards ready.

The first full deck of 40/50 cards might be released at PuppetConf 2018.
