Setup PSICK as in Card[1] then install Vagrant with:

    bin/vagrant_setup.sh

Move to any of the available Vagrant environments:

    cd vagrant/environment/ostest

Show available Vagrant boxes and start one of them

    vagrant status
    vagrant up centos7.ostest.psick.io

VM is provisioned using PSICK's local Puppet code and data.

Standard Puppet control-repo dirs and files:

  - **manifests/** - The main manifests directory
  - **hieradata/** - The dir with Hiera data files
  - **Puppetfile** - The file with the list of extra modules to deploy
  - **modules/** - The dir where modules are deployed 
  - **environment.conf** - The Environment configuration file
  - **hiera.yaml** - The Environment Hiera configuration file

PSICK additional dirs:

  - **bin/** - Scripts and tools used in development and CI
  - **docs/** - PSICK docs
  - **vagrant/** - Several different Vagrant environments
  - **fabfile/** - Fabric scripts
  - **spec/** - Control repo spec tests

Run the VMs with your OS of choice:

    cd vagrant/environment/ostest
    vagrant up <os>.ostest.psick.io

Check what role is linked by the special ostest.yaml symlink

    cd ../../../
    ls -l hieradata/role/ostest.yaml

Change the role to test on your VMs:

    hieradata/role/vpn.yaml hieradata/role/ostest.yaml

Run Puppet on your VMs testing the new role

    cd vagrant/environment/ostest
    vagrant provision 


## 7 The psick module

Psick is composed of:

  - a sample control-repo
  - a reusable Puppet module

Install the Puppet module with one of:

    puppet module install example42-psick
    git clone https://github.com/example42/puppet-psick

Psick module provides:

  - Structured and ordered classification
  - Base profiles for common OS management operations
  - TP profiles for common applications

## 9 OPS tp commands

## 10 OPS Docker

## 11 PROD Puppet server setup

## 12 PROD Puppet CI

PSICK supports CI/CD of Puppet code using different tools.

  - Jenkins pipeline is configured in ```Jenkinsfile```
  - GitLab CI is configured in ```.gitlab-ci.yml```
  - Travis integration is configured in ```.travis.yaml```

In many CI steps are used scripts under the ```bin/``` dir.

Puppet CI involve:

  - lint, syntax, unit, integrations tests.
  - Puppet code deployment and progressive rollout
  - Canary runs in noop and no-noop mode
  - Git commit automatic feedback and docs generation
